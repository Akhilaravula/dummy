# Dummy
=====
A toolkit for rapid prototyping and QA

### Dummy can…
+ Crop and size placeholder images from a random pool, or from a specific folder or subset of folders.
+ Randomly select and insert strings of Lorem Ipsum in various predefined formats. Or roll your own formats.
+ Create simple, human readable probability statements that make your static feel dynamic.
+ More! Not lots more. But a bit more.

### You can…
+ See demos
+ See docs
+ Give feedback

### Intro
Dummy is a content generation toolkit designed to make the development, testing and presentation of web prototypes less time consuming and more realistic. Whether you're meticulously crafting a fully responsive front-end with a myriad of CSS breakpoints, or just slapping together a half-baked idea – Dummy makes it easier to visualize, test and present something closer to what your finished front-end will look like.

It does so by helping you to populate your dummy with content and randomizing key aspects of it's layout, in this way simulating connectivity to a live database.

**Dummy is for the front-end web worker who wonders…**

+ How does this layout hold up without an image – or – with a landscape (instead of a portrait) oriented image?

+ What is the maximum number of items that can appear in this list before it breaks the layout, or before it just stops looking good?

+ How does the columns balance as the content changes – and what's the longest word that can fit into this column without triggering unwanted overflow?

+ What is the easiest way to demo the signed-in and signed-out states of this page?

### Why?
Using it in the early stages of front-end development can give you a new perspective on your work every time a document is reloaded, shortening and improving your test cycle by more quickly exposing weak-points or trouble areas as you go about marking up a new design.

This is especially important for front-end code that should be delivered to another team for implementation as part of a phased hand-off. As any front-ender knows, the earlier you can catch a problem the easier it will be to debug it.

### TODO
+ It's probably a bad idea to ship this with a bandwidth hogging library of images in assets/images. It would make more sense to maintain separate asset packages for different types of projects. (e.g. a commerce/store package, portfolio or showcase package)
+ Integrate a lorum Ipsum generator, together with some clever syntax for specifying what you want generated.
+ Ability to call and define image crops from within CSS
+ Performance, performance, performance.
